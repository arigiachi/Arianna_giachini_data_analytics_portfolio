# Arianna Giachini - Data Analytics and Data Science Portfolio ![](images/IMG_0022.jpeg)

Hello! I'm Arianna Giachini, a passionate scientist researcher with a rich background in data-driven problem solving. For almost 3 years, I worked as a scientist for an early stage startup that was developing cell-cultivated meat. We extracted cells from cows and grew them in the lab! 

I've honed my skills in experimental design, hypothesis testing, and diving deep into complex datasets to extract actionable insights. With an unwavering curiosity, I believe in understanding the challenge and leveraging creativity to uncover solutions.

My diverse experience in the biotech landscape has equipped me with unique perspectives and methodologies, which I'm keen to apply beyond the lab. I want to use my Github page to leverage advanced analytical techniques and robust data management practices to extract actionable insights across diverse domains.

Let's connect and explore collaborative possibilities!



## Project 1: Starting a Tourism Agency in Buenos Aires, Argentina
* *Context:* My friend Gabriel Tupaj is an exceptional tourist guide, frequently hired by travel agencies to lead tours in Buenos Aires. Passionate about his work, Gabriel aspires to start his own tourism agency but is unsure of the steps needed to make it successful.
  
* *Goal:* Develop actionable insights from tourist data to understand market demand, seasonal patterns, and visitor preferences in Buenos Aires' tourism sector.
  
* *Datasets used:* Analysis based on public datasets provided by Argentina's Tourism Information System (SINTA - Sistema de Información Turística de la Argentina). Names of datasets:
  - Non-resident tourists, overnight stays, and average monthly stay duration at Ezeiza and Aeroparque airports (original file name: Turistas no residentes, pernoctaciones y estadía media mensual en Ezeiza y Aeroparque)
  - Tourists and overnight stays by travel purpose, destination province, and visited destinations(original file name: Turistas y pernoctes según motivo de viaje, por provincia de destino y destinos visitados)
